/* FM-1 LCD wiring: SPI1 on PC9 CLK, PC10 DO, PC7 CS,
 * PC8 D/C; PA2, active low: the backlight, and more. The panel protocol is src/lcd.c.
 *
 * PA2 is not the backlight alone. Low = the backlight AND the key matrix / 595 chain alive (the keys, the buttons,
 * the knobs, the LEDs: hal/fm1_input.h); high = both dead (very likely one enable of the supply that feeds the
 * panel, the 595s and the LEDs). Seen on the unit 2026-10-10, twice over: the screen off of 0.14 / 0.15 drove PA2
 * high for the backlight and the unit went deaf (no key sounded or woke the screen; a SysEx from the computer
 * brought the screen back and the keys with it); and before fm1_lcd_hw_init has pulled PA2 low (the boot stub) a
 * held key does not read through the 595 chain, which the same read does after it. So PA2 is driven low once,
 * here, and nothing raises it again while the firmware runs: there is no backlight switch (the screen "off" is a
 * black frame with the backlight on, src/cr_ui.c cr_ui_draw). No other writer of PA's OUT / DIR touches bit 2:
 * hal/fm1_input.h sets and clears its own bits (1, 3, 4, 9, 10) with read-modify-writes.
 *
 *   fm1_lcd_hw_init()          pins, PA2 low (for good: see above), SPI1 master at BAUD 4
 *   fm1_lcd_baud(b)            SPI1 clock = lsb / (b + 1)
 *   fm1_lcd_send_cmd(c)        D/C low, CS low, one byte (then fm1_lcd_wait)
 *   fm1_lcd_send_data(p, n)    D/C high, CS low, DMA n bytes from RAM p
 *   fm1_lcd_wait()             SPI done (or timeout, counted), pending cleared
 *   fm1_lcd_deselect()         CS high
